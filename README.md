Hi! I am currently a master’s student at Tsinghua University advised by Prof Yong Li, doing research at the Future Intelligent Lab (FIB-Lab). Before that, I received my B.S. from Tongji University advised by Prof. Yaobao Yin. My research areas include urban data mining, wireless network digital twins, and energy optimization. I am also very interested in embodied intelligence, robotics, and motion planning, to create Human-like AI and improve people’s lives.

This repository contains the source code for my website, where I showcase my research, projects, publications, and blog posts. In here I share my work in urban data mining, robotics, wireless networks, and motion planning and connect with others. Explore my portfolio, learn more about my research, and get in touch!
